survivr_1 REFLECTIONS

This GEM uses RUBY's metaprogramming capabilites when new methods to change the colors of strings are added to the String
class.

I estimate I spent about 9 hours working on this project.

The most rewarding challenge conquered was learning how to correctly structure gem files and how to properly build and install
gems. Also learning the correct syntax for adding classes was rewarding. The whole project was challenging and completing it was very rewarding.

I still have much more to learn regarding Ruby syntax and logic.
